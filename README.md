# Real time MNIST classifier with Tensorflow JS

This is a production tensorflow model running on the browser with Tensorflow JS. You can draw digits on the left canvas and the probability distribution for each label will be displayed on the left.
I wanted to explore how I'd go about deploying a model with TFJS, instead of writing a Django API directly with Tensorflow.
